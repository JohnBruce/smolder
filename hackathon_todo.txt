Easy
========
+ Add screenshots to POD (Smolder.pm)
+ Move inline CSS to style sheets
+ Allow anonymous uploads via smolder_smoke_signal
+ Add good documentation for configuration
+ Change Build.PL so that only Smolder, Smolder::Manual, smolder, smolderctl and smolder_smoke_signal 
  are viewable in search.cpan.org
+ RT #52338 (log file getting truncated)
+ RT #49993 (default port)


Medium
========
+ Get /static urls outputting better HTTP headers to improve browser caching
+ Handle SKIP ALL better (showing more information rather than just "No tests run"
+ Precompile all templates at startup (speeds it up and increases shared memory)
+ RT #49989 (JS error)
+ Change URLs so public and private projects are accessed over the same URL

Hard
========
+ Design Plugin Architecture
  + adding and overriding templates and htdocs
  + adding sql tables
  + adding code
+ Create a full search system of smoke reports, not just a listing
  by most recent. This would allow for searching based on project,
  status, category, etc
+ Import/Export of projects so you can move them around different Smolder installs
