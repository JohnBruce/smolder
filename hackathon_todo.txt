Easy
========
1) Add screenshots to POD (Smolder.pm)
2) Move inline CSS to style sheets
3) Allow anonymous uploads via smolder_smoke_signal
4) Add good documentation for configuration
5) Change Build.PL so that only Smolder, Smolder::Manual, smolder, smolderctl and smolder_smoke_signal 
  are viewable in search.cpan.org
6) RT #52338 (log file getting truncated)
7) RT #49993 (default port)
16) Add "LogLevel" smolder.conf directive


Medium
========
8) Get /static urls outputting better HTTP headers to improve browser caching
9) Handle SKIP ALL better (showing more information rather than just "No tests run"

Hard
========
13) Design Plugin Architecture
  + adding and overriding templates and htdocs
  + adding sql tables
  + adding code
14) Create a full search system of smoke reports, not just a listing
  by most recent. This would allow for searching based on project,
  status, category, etc
15) Import/Export of projects so you can move them around different Smolder installs
